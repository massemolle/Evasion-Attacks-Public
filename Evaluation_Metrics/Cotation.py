class CotationTable:
    """
    CotationTable evaluates the difficulty of an evasion attack based on several criteria.
    
    Evaluation Criteria:
    
    1. Elapsed Time / Feasibility:
       - Considers the time needed to mount the attack, the attackâ€™s success rate, 
         the average L2 perturbation size, and other relevant metrics.
       - Feasibility is classified as High, Medium, or Low based on these factors.
       
    2. Attacker Knowledge:
       - Laymen: Can follow publicly available instructions and operate off-the-shelf tools.
       - Proficient: Has basic training/experience with standard attack techniques.
       - Expert: Possesses deep technical skills and can implement complex or novel attacks.
       - Multiple experts: A coordinated team or a single individual with interdisciplinary expertise.
       
    3. Target Knowledge:
       - White-box: Complete access to the target (e.g., internal model details) which might be harder to obtain.
       - Gray-box: Partial knowledge about the target.
       - Black-box: Limited knowledge; only observable input/output behavior.
       
    4. Equipment:
       - Evaluates the hardware used. In this example, we assume a basic computer, but more powerful 
         equipment (high-end PC, server/cloud resources, specialized GPU clusters) would affect the attack's feasibility.
       
    5. Extrapolation Time:
       - An estimation of the time needed to build and perform the attack on a more complex system.
       - Options include: "1 day", "1 week", "Multiple weeks", "Months".
       
    Additional Metrics Included:
       - GPU/CPU consumption (current snapshot).
       - Number of model queries performed during the attack (if reported).
       - Attack parameters (epsilon, step_size, num_steps)
       
    The module calculates a total difficulty score normalized to a 0-10 scale (with 10 being the most difficult)
    and produces a detailed rating that includes both the numeric score and qualitative considerations.
